# Project-Hiker

Our team wants to build the ultimate resource for outdoor enthusiasts and the casual hiker. This app would allow users to see some of the most beautiful hiking trails, scenery and campsites across North America.  Users will see what outdoor destinations are nearby, how to get to them, and what they can expect to find once they get there.  They will also get information about weather conditions.

At launch, the app should offer information about:
* Parks, trails, and campsites in the area
* Driving directions
* Weather conditions

Roadmap for further development:
* Plants and animals
* Scenery (waterfalls, lakes, etc.)
* Stargazing and astronomy

Potential APIs to use:
* Google Maps (for location and directions)
* Open Weather Map
* World Weather Online (sunrise, sunset, moon)

User stories:
* People who like to be outside
* People who want to discover new places
* People looking to be more active
* People looking for places to relax and BBQ
